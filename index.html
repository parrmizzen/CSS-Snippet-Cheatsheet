                <p>I am twenty six years old and this is my first ever start into the beautiful journey of coding. I
                    have been working dilligentally to create as many projects as I can. Unfortunately, due to time
                    restraints and lack of knowledge I have not created as many projects as I would like.</p>
                <p>I like my work to be an exstension of myself and show that I am ready to tackle any obstacle that can
                    be thrown at me. I have always had an adapt and overcome attitude taught to me by the United States
                    Air Force. They taught me many things while I was with them in my search and rescue squadron; like
                    the ability to problem solve any situation and when to know that it would be counter productive to
                    try and problem solve on my own.</p>
                <p>My previous work experience has either been in logistics or in the electrical field. Both of these
                    jobs have given me the ground work to overcome any obstacle and know how to handle set backs.</p>
