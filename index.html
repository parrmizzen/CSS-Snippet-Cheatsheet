            <p>I am twenty six years old and this is my first ever start into the beautiful journey of coding. I
                have been working dilligentally to create as many projects as I can. Unfortunately, due to time
                restraints and lack of knowledge I have not created as many projects as I would like.</p>
            <p>I like my work to be an exstension of myself and show that I am ready to tackle any obstacle that can
                be thrown at me. I have always had an adapt and overcome attitude taught to me by the United States
                Air Force. They taught me many things while I was with them in my search and rescue squadron; like
                the ability to problem solve any situation and when to know that it would be counter productive to
                try and problem solve on my own.</p>
            <p>My previous work experience has either been in logistics or in the electrical field. Both of these
                jobs have given me the ground work to overcome any obstacle and know how to handle set backs.</p>

            <h2> Work </h2>
            <P>I have an understanding in the basics of HTML and CSS. I have created two websites from scratch using CSS
                and one basic website using HTML. I feel that I can proficiently find anything that I need in order to
                problem solve a website. I have porblem solving skills and adaptablity to overcome any situation I need.
